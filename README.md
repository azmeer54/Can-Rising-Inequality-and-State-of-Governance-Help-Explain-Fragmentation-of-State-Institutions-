# Can_Rising_Inequality_and_State_of_Governance_Help_Explain_Factionalization_of_Elites


Using panel data regression method on a global sample of 158 countries and time period of 12 years ranging from 2009 to 2020, the study aims to study the impact of inequality and governance indicators on the factionalization of elites in societies. Data drawn from three main data sources, namely, Fragile States Index, Positive Peace Index and Freedom in the World. The study uses both static and dynamic panel data models. The two-step difference GMM approach, under the assumption of heteroskedasticity, shows a general negative relationship of inequality measures with factionalized elites' indicator while governance indicators show strong and positive relationship.
